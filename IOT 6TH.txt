CODE: 

const int green_led = 0;
const int yellow_led = 1;
const int red_led = 2;
unsigned int counter;
void setup() {
// put your setup code here, to run once:
pinMode(green_led, OUTPUT);

Hereâ€™s what the code does:

It defines three integer constants green_led, yellow_led, and red_led, representing the pin numbers for the corresponding LEDs.
The counter variable is used to keep track of the loop iterations.
In the setup() function:
The pin modes for the LEDs are set to OUTPUT.
All LEDs (green, yellow, and red) are turned on initially.
In the loop() function:
The counter is incremented by 1.
Depending on the value of counter, different LED states are set:
If counter is less than or equal to 100, the yellow LED is on, the green LED is off, and the red LED is on.
If counter is between 100 and 200, the yellow LED is off, the green LED is on, and the red LED is on.
If counter is greater than 200, the yellow LED is on, the green LED is on, and the red LED is off.
If counter exceeds 210, it is reset to 0.
