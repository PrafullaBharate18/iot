unsigned int red,green,blue;

blue = (blue/4);
RGB_color(255-red, 255-green, 255-blue); // Red delay(1000);

void RGB_color(int red_light_value, int green_light_value, int blue_light_value)

Hereâ€™s what the code does:

It defines three integer variables red_light_pin, green_light_pin, and blue_light_pin, representing the pin numbers for the corresponding RGB LEDs.
The red, green, and blue variables are declared to store analog readings.
In the setup() function:
The pin modes for the RGB LEDs are set to OUTPUT.
In the loop() function:
Analog readings are taken from pins A0, A2, and A3.
The values are divided by 4 (presumably to scale them down).
The RGB_color function is called with inverted values (255 minus the original values) to control the RGB LEDs.
There is a delay of 1 second.
The RGB_color function:
Sets the PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) values for the RGB LEDs based on the input parameters.
