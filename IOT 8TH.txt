CODE: 

void setup() {
// put your setup code here, to run once:
Serial.begin(9600);
Serial.println("input the number");
}
void loop() {
// put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
DYPCOEI-IQAC-DOC: D- 002
int input = Serial.parseInt(); // keep other operations outside the sq function
int inputSquared = sq(input);
Serial.print(int(inputSquared));
delay(500);
}


Here’s what the code does:

In the setup() function:
Serial communication is initialized with a baud rate of 9600.
The message “input the number” is printed to the serial monitor.
In the loop() function:
The program continuously runs in a loop.
It reads an integer input from the serial monitor.
The square of the input is calculated using the sq() function.
The squared value is printed to the serial monitor.
There is a delay of 500 milliseconds before the next iteration
