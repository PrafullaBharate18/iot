IOT 10TH

CODE: 

Monitor Code:
#include <dht.h>
dht DHT;
#define DHT11_PIN A1
void setup()
{
Serial.begin(9600);
Serial.println("Humidity (%),\tTemperature (C)"); }
void loop()
{
// READ DATA
int chk = DHT.read11(DHT11_PIN);
// DISPLAY DATA
Serial.print(DHT.humidity, 1);
Serial.print("\t");
Serial.println(DHT.temperature, 1);
delay(1000);
}


Here’s what the code does:

It includes the dht library, which is commonly used for interfacing with DHT11 and DHT22 humidity and temperature sensors.
The DHT11_PIN is defined as A1, indicating that the DHT11 sensor is connected to analog pin A1.
In the setup() function:
Serial communication is initialized with a baud rate of 9600.
The message “Humidity (%), Temperature ©” is printed to the serial monitor.
In the loop() function:
The DHT.read11(DHT11_PIN) function reads data from the DHT11 sensor.
The humidity and temperature values are retrieved from the DHT object.
The humidity value is printed with one decimal place, followed by a tab character (\t), and then the temperature value with one decimal place.
There is a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) before the next iteration.
