CODE: 

#include <dht.h>
dht DHT;
#define DHT11_PIN A1
float min_t,max_t;
void setup()
{
DYPCOEI-IQAC-DOC: D- 002
Serial.begin(9600);
Serial.println("Humidity (%),\tTemperature (F)"); min_t = 0xffff;
max_t=0x00;
}
void loop()
{
// READ DATA
int chk = DHT.read11(DHT11_PIN);
// DISPLAY DATA
Serial.print(DHT.humidity, 1);
Serial.print("\t");
Serial.println((DHT.temperature*1.8)+32, 1);

delay(1000);
}


Here’s what the updated code does:

It includes the dht library, which is commonly used for interfacing with DHT11 and DHT22 humidity and temperature sensors.
The DHT11_PIN is defined as A1, indicating that the DHT11 sensor is connected to analog pin A1.
The min_t and max_t variables are declared as float to store minimum and maximum temperature values.
In the setup() function:
Serial communication is initialized with a baud rate of 9600.
The message “Humidity (%), Temperature (F)” is printed to the serial monitor.
The min_t is initialized to a large value (0xffff), and max_t is initialized to a small value (0x00).
In the loop() function:
The program continuously runs in a loop.
The DHT.read11(DHT11_PIN) function reads data from the DHT11 sensor.
The humidity and temperature values are retrieved from the DHT object.
The temperature value is converted from Celsius to Fahrenheit using the formula (Celsius * 1.8) + 32.
The humidity and converted temperature values are printed to the serial monitor.
There is a delay of 1000 milliseconds (1 second) before the next iteration.
